            <h2>Unlock Your Tricks:</h2>
            <h4>Here are some tricks you will want to learn through your journey of skateboarding. We recommend you start with the beginner tricks then move up to the amateur tricks and then advanced after you master the first two sets.</h4>
            <h2>Beginner Tricks:</h2>
            <h3>The Ollie:</h3>
            <p>Essentially the ollie is one of the very first tricks you will learn. It is the foundation to almost all other tricks. An ollie is when you get both sides of the board to pop up at the same time. Kind of like jumping the board comes up with you. Let's take a look at how it's done.</p>

            <h3>The Pop Shuv-It:</h3>
            <p>The pop shuv-it is very similar to the ollie only, only this time you are rotating the board at least 180 degrees. There are more than one ways to doing so. You can either push the board forward with your front foot and pull the board backward with your back foot or you can do the opposite. Some people are often able to do this trick before they learn how to ollie. Lets see how this is done.</p>

            <h3>Back/Frontside 180:</h3>
            <p>The final trick on our list for beginners is the back and frontside 180. This trick is very similar to the pop shuv-it. The biggest differrence is instead of rotating the board underneath you, you rotate your body with the board doing a 180. It is recommended to get an ollie down before you do this trick because it uses the same concept. Lets see how it's done.</p>
