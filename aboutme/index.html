    <h2>Brandon "Busty" Ansbergs</h2>
    <p>Hey class! My name is Brandon Ansbergs, my close friends call me "Busty". I was born and raised in Vancouver Washington 
    which is about 15 minutes North of Portland Oregon.
    I come from a larrge split family. I am 1 of 10 siblings being the oldest boy. I have 2 oldrer sisters, 5 younger sisters, and 2 younger brothers.
    I was born and raised in the church but went inactive wnhen I turned 18. 
    I have recently found my way back to the church in the last year and hope to grow my testimony as I attend this school.
    This is my first semester at BYUi. My major is currently Computer Science and I hope to minor in Machine Learning. 
    I earned my associates while attending high school so I have about 3 years left to complete my degree. </p>
    <p>A few of my hobbies include sksateboarding, snowboarding, working on cars, and racing cars at the track. I also play a lot of video games like Apex Legends, 
    Valorant, the Need for Speed franchise, UFC 3 and 4, League of Legends, OverWatch 2, and Risk of Rain 2. I love making art, specifically graffiti (legally). 
    I am a huge fan of watching UFC! Back home you'd catch me at your local Buffalo Wild Wings every saturday watching the fights. 
    I used to wrestle in high scchool and would like to get into MMA after graduating.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you all for taking a little time out of your day too learn some small things about me. I am excited to get to know each one of you a bit more during the course of this semester.</p>
